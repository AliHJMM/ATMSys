# ATM Management System

A terminal-based ATM management application written in **C**, using **SQLite** for data storage. This project demonstrates core programming logic, file/database handling, user authentication, and CRUD operations through a user-friendly terminal UI.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ User Authentication

- Register new users (unique usernames only)
- Login system with password validation
- Secure interaction with SQLite (no plain text file handling)

### 🏦 Account Management

- Create Account with the following fields:
  - Account number (unique, 8–12 digits)
  - Creation date
  - Country (letters only)
  - Phone number (unique, 8 digits)
  - Balance (up to $5000)
  - Account type (`saving`, `current`, `fixed01`, `fixed02`, `fixed03`)
- View all accounts owned by a user
- View specific account details with interest calculation:
  - `saving`: 7% annual (monthly)
  - `fixed01`: 4% (1 year)
  - `fixed02`: 5% (2 years)
  - `fixed03`: 8% (3 years)
  - `current`: No interest

### 🔄 Update Account

- Update account country or phone number
- Validates format and uniqueness where needed

### 💸 Transactions

- Deposit and withdraw money
- Allowed only for `saving` and `current` accounts
- Validates amount and balance

### 🗑️ Delete Account

- Delete accounts owned by logged-in user
- Validates account number and ownership

### 🔁 Transfer Ownership

- Transfer account to another registered user
- Instant update in database
